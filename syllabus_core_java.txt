You're absolutely rightâ€”Collections Framework is a core part of Java, and I should have explicitly included it in the list of Core Java concepts earlier. Let me revise the concepts to include it appropriately. Here's the corrected list:

Core Java Concepts (Including Collections Framework)
1. Basics of Java
Introduction to Java
JVM, JDK, JRE
Java Program Structure
Data Types
Variables and Constants
Operators
Control Statements:
Decision-making (if, else, switch)
Loops (for, while, do-while)
Jump Statements (break, continue, return)
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Class and Object
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism:
Method Overloading
Method Overriding
Abstraction:
Abstract Classes
Interfaces
Constructors:
Default and Parameterized
Constructor Overloading
this and super Keywords
Static Members (Methods and Variables)
3. String Handling
String Class and Methods
StringBuffer
StringBuilder
4. Exception Handling
Try, Catch, Finally
Throw and Throws
Built-in Exceptions
Custom Exceptions
5. Multithreading
Thread Creation:
Using Thread Class
Using Runnable Interface
Thread Lifecycle
Synchronization
Inter-thread Communication (wait(), notify(), notifyAll())
6. Java Packages
Built-in Packages (java.lang, java.util, java.io)
User-defined Packages
Access Modifiers:
public
private
protected
default
7. Java I/O (Input/Output)
Byte Streams: InputStream, OutputStream
Character Streams: Reader, Writer
File Handling: File Class, FileReader, FileWriter
8. Wrapper Classes
Autoboxing and Unboxing
Primitive to Object Conversion
9. Collections Framework (Now Explicitly Included)
Introduction to Collections Framework
Benefits over Arrays
Hierarchy of Collections Framework
Key Interfaces and Implementations
List (ArrayList, LinkedList)
Set (HashSet, LinkedHashSet)
Map (HashMap, LinkedHashMap)
Common Operations
Adding, removing, accessing, and iterating elements.
Iterators
Using Iterator to traverse collections.
10. Basic Memory Management
Stack and Heap Memory
Garbage Collection
11. Inner Classes
Static Inner Class
Non-static Inner Class
Anonymous Inner Class
